		Since the dawn of time, man has bathed. It has developed over the years, but one thing remains paramount: cleansing. From the practical sense of becoming physically clean to using the time to unwind and cleanse the soul, this has always been the key to a great bath.
	</p>

	<p>
		Over time, attention spans decreased. Children could no longer handle a bath without something to revert their attention. There was a need to invent a toy; a bathtub friendly toy. And so, the rubber duck was born!
	</p>

	<p>
		The history of the rubber duck is linked to the emergence of rubber manufacturing in the late 19th century. The earliest rubber ducks were made from harder rubber. Sculptor Peter Ganine created a sculpture of a duck in the 1940s, then patented it and reproduced it as a floating toy, of which over 50,000,000 were sold. Seeing this is when we began to realize, this toy ain't ducking around!
	</p>

	<p>
		Rubber Ducks were inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2013. A toy does not reach such high levels of respect without having a wider reach than just our world's youth.They were of course created with children in mind, but who says they should have all the fun?
	</p>

	<p>
		Adults have a tough life. After a hard day at work, many want nothing more than to relax in the tub with a glass of wine. At Lucky Ducks, we meet the needs of those who want the tub, but instead of craving alcohol, desperately want a trip down memory lane (or in this case, stream).

	</p>

	<p>
		Lucky Ducks provides a variety of fun products for the kid in every adult. Look at our whimsical designs and you cannot help but smile. We have so many options, there is no one we can't please with one of our beaks!
	</p>

	<p>
		So, before you say this isn't for you, before you say you don't need a duck to make you happy, take a look. Peruse our site and we guarantee you will find a feather to tickle your fancy. So take a dive into Lucky, and as always:
