<h1>About Us</h1>
<h3>How We Waddled Into This Quacked Up Business</h3>

<div id="duckInWater"></div>

<div class= "content">

	<p>
		Since the dawn of time, man has bathed. It has developed over the years, but one thing remains paramount: cleansing. From the practical sense of becoming physically clean to using the time to unwind and cleanse the soul, this has always been the key to a great bath.
	</p>

	<p>
		Over time, attention spans decreased. Children could no longer handle a bath without something to revert their attention. There was a need to invent a toy; a bathtub friendly toy. And so, the rubber duck was born! But who says children should have all the fun?
	</p>

	<p>
		Adults have a tough life. After a hard day at work, many want nothing more than to relax in the tub with a glass of wine. At Lucky, we meet the needs of those who want the tub, but instead of craving alcohol, desperately want a trip down memory lane (or in this case, stream).

	</p>

	<p>
		Lucky provides a variety of fun products for the kid in every adult. Look at our whimsical designs and you cannot help but smile. We have so many options, there is no one we can't please with one of our beaks!
	</p>

	<p>
		So, before you say this isn't for you, before you say you don't need a duck to make you happy, take a look. Peruse our site and we guarantee you will find a feather to tickle your fancy. So take a dive into Lucky, and as always:
	</p>
